#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It enables the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortan,C were developed, making it easy for people to write instructions for computers.
Sofware Engineering was established as a discipline in the 1960s.
Structured programming was intoduced in the 1970s as a way of making code more organized. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s changed how teams worked by making software development more flexible and efficient.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-The sofware developers and stakeholders gather to define what the sofware should do and the problems it will be solving.
Design- High-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created.
Implementation- Developers write the actualcode based on the design specifications
Testing- Various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-The sofware is released to users or customers.
Maintenance- Ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software are provided after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and agile are both methodologies of software developpment. They both aim to create functional sofware. However, waterfall methodology follows a step-by-step linear process where each face must be completed before moving onto the next. This makes it rigid and less adaptable to changes. The minimal customer engagement after initials stages of planning make it ideal for projects with clear defined requirements such as government or banking where changes are expensive. Agile methodology differs from the waterfall methodology in its iterative and flexible approach where development happens in small sprints allowing for continous feedbacks and improvements. Agile works best for dynamic projects, like mobile apps or startups, where user needs may evolve over time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A sofware developer writes the actual code that makes the software work. They design, develop, and maintain applications based on project requirements. 
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. Their goal is to catch problems before the product reaches customers.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.  They set timelines, assign tasks, manage resources, and communicate with stakeholders. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include Git, and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. To handle this, teams can adopt Agile methodologies, which promote flexibility through iterative development, frequent feedback, and continuous reassessment of goals.
Tight deadlines can result in rushed develompment and compromised quality. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines as well as prioritization of tasks can help manage this pressure.
Technical debts accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. Allocating time for code refactoring and implementing automated testing to detect pontetial issues early can ensure that the code remains clean, efficient, and easy to maintain over time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software. It helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of major failures later.
Integration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.  Integration testing ensures seamless communication between different parts of the system.
System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole. It ensures the software behaves as intended in a real-world environment before release.
Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This step ensures that the final product is both functional and user-friendly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting precise and effective prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. Prompt engineering enhances communication between humans and AI by making human instructions clear and specific, so that AI understands what exactly it is needed by the user.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about cake.
Improved prompt- Can you share the history of chocolate cake, including where it came from, its main ingredients, and some popular variations?
Why the improved prompt is better- The improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise. The vague prompt is too broad. There are so many kinds of cakes, and the AI might go in any direction. The improved version is much clearer. It focuses on chocolate cake, asks for its history, and even requests details like ingredients and variations. This way, the AI knows exactly is needed, making the response more useful and interesting
